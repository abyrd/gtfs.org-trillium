# GTFS Examples

To help in understanding the GTFS specification and in producing tools that read and write GTFS data, take a look at the following examples of GTFS feeds:

* The [Example GTFS Feed](https://github.com/google/transit/tree/master/gtfs/spec/en/examples) page provides a simple GTFS feed that can be used as a model to understand how a GTFS feed is put together.
* The [GTFS Examples](http://bit.ly/gtfs-examples) document shows 11 examples that each illustrate GTFS concepts.
* A list of transit agency feeds available from the [GoogleTransitDataFeed project site](http://code.google.com/p/googletransitdatafeed/wiki/PublicFeeds) is a good place to start.
