# Testing GTFS Feeds

The following Open Source tools are available for testing feeds in the GTFS format:

* Use the [FeedValidator](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/FeedValidator) tool to verify that your feed data file matches the specification defined in this document.
* Use the [ScheduleViewer](https://github.com/google/transitfeed/wiki/ScheduleViewer) application to see your feed data represented on a map. This is not representative of how your data will look in other applications; it is a basic tool for testing. Examine routes and schedules to ensure that the data feed correctly represents your system.
