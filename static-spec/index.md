# Changing the GTFS Static Spec

## Overview

The [GTFS reference documentation](https://github.com/google/transit) is not set in stone. Instead, it is an open specification developed and maintained by the community of transit agencies, developers, and other stakeholders who use GTFS. It is expected that this community of producers and consumers of GTFS data will have proposals for extending the spec to enable new capabilities. To help manage that process, procedures and guidelines have been established. See [GTFS Amendment Process](https://github.com/google/transit/blob/master/gtfs/CHANGES.md).
